# Optimizing Classification Performance in Google Earth Engine 
## Background
In recent years, cloud-based platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) have become increasingly popular across a wide range of scientific and applied disciplines. Allowing easy access to petabytes of earth observation data GEE has revolutionized remote sensing workflows, enabling large-scale and long-term analyses that were previously limited by hardware constraints. For operational functions GEE allows spatial and spectral analyses to be applied to batches of imagery, supporting simple mathematical calculations to more advance machine learning algorithms [Perez-Cutillas et al 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100907). Both supervised and unsupervised classification are supported in GEE, allowing user to utilized well established classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and many more. However, at the present GEE lacks support of hyperparameter optimization/tuning, unlike more common machine learning library, such as scikit-learn. Since machine learning generalization capability relies upon user defined parameters, finding the optimum parameter combination is critical part in machine learning workflow. In this repository, I will shared some approach for optimizing machine learning performance in GEE python API. The approach is
